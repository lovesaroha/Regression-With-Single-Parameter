# Regression-With-Single-Parameter
In statistics, simple linear regression is a linear regression model with a single explanatory variable.That is, it concerns two-dimensional sample points with one independent variable and one dependent variable (conventionally, the x and y coordinates in a Cartesian coordinate system) and finds a linear function (a non-vertical straight line) that, as accurately as possible, predicts the dependent variable values as a function of the independent variables.
